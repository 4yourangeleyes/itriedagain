```bash
npm run setup-northcell
```
This reloads all templates with clauses.

**Solution 2: Add clauses manually**

2. Click "Open Clause Manager"
3. Browse library and add required clauses
4. Start with the 8 required clauses
5. Add optional clauses as needed

### "I don't see Clause Manager button"

Check that:

- You're on the Canvas screen
- Look for a button like "Manage Clauses" or "Edit Clauses"

### "Clause content is too generic"

**Solution: Customize each clause**
1. Open Clause Manager
2. Click "Edit" on each clause
3. Replace placeholder text:
   - "[Company Name]" → "Northcell Studios"
   - "[Client Name]" → Actual client name
   - "[Project Description]" → Specific project details
   - "[Amount]" → Actual fee
   - "[Timeline]" → Actual dates
